It was likely a class added when for a planned feature that was later reconsidered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Abstract Representation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The changes made to the abstract architecture were minor, it was mostly a case of extending it to complete the product. This is because the object oriented architecture fit the code nicely as it accurately represented the java code that would be created from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The component diagram and usage diagram were combined into a single diagram. This change did not affect the readability of the new diagram, and compressed the information. It was changed this way because there was a large overlap between the two diagrams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The layout of the remaining diagrams was changed for clarity. Classes are now arranged such that child classes are below their parent class. This makes the diagram clearer, which is important as their original diagrams were harder to follow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There were a few mistakes in the inheritance and cardinality that were fixed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Concrete Representation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There were minimal changes to the concrete architecture as it was still the best way to represent an object oriented language like the java code it turns into.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The same clarity changes were made to both the inheritance and the complete class diagram, as well as the same inheritance and cardinality fixed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Justification Relating to Requirements</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We simply extended the justification, below is a list of all the extensions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_AWARDS - </span><span class="c1">The class SceneAwardScreen is the final screen for when the player wins the game, It is displayed if the player wins. The class SceneResultsScreen will display the final times of the player, as well as have the logic to determine when the player won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_COLLISIONS- </span><span class="c1">The class Boat has a method called hasDied() that returns a boolean value when the player has died. This is then used in SceneMainGame to send the player to a game over screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_DIFFICULTY_LEVELS - </span><span class="c1">The Class SceneDifficulty was added to give &nbsp;users a menu between selecting their boat spec and starting the trial leg, from which they can select their difficulty level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">FR_PLAYER_DIFFICULTY - </span><span class="c1">The PlayerBoat Class will use the result of SceneDifficulty to set the difficulty level for the player.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_TRIAL_LEG - </span><span class="c1">The Boat class&rsquo; getBestTime() method was changed to add the times from the first and second leg together rather than the best time of all legs. Meaning the first leg became a trial leg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_POWER_UP - </span><span class="c1">The Abstract class PowerUp and all its children detail another implementation of collisionObject that will give the player bonuses when they interact with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_SAVE - </span><span class="c1">The class GameState implements saving by creating an instance of SerializableGameObject for the objects and serializing the entire GameState Class to save the game, allowing the player to load it from SceneLoadScreen at a later date.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">UR_PAUSE | UR_LOAD - </span><span class="c1">The Class SceneSaveScreen allows the player to pause the game mid leg, and return to the leg from the paused state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"></p> <a href="../architecture.html">Link to architecture diagrams</a> </body></html>
